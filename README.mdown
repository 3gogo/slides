# Slide Presentation Framework

I got fed up with using Powerpoint and Keynote to make and give presentations, so I wrote this framework.  It uses slides in plain HTML, combined with themes, layouts, and slide transitions in CSS, and a small Javascript MVC framework for showing them.

## How do I use it?

### Quick start

1. Download it
	- You may want to open index.html in your browser to read a bit more about the framework.
1. Put numbered HTML slide files in the slides directory
	- There are example slides there now.  You may want to look at them for format ideas, and then move them aside.
1. Open index.html in your browser

### Not-so-quick start
